## Aim:
To design a basic mobile and web layout for a selected case study by applying Gestalt principles, incorporating appropriate UI elements, and following standard design patterns to improve usability and user experience.

## Algorithm:
1. Select the Case Study

Choose an existing application (e.g., Food Delivery App – QuickBite) for redesign.

2. Analyze User Requirements

Identify the target users, their needs, goals, and common problems while using the application.

3. Create Wireframes

Sketch low-fidelity wireframes for both mobile and web layouts to define the structure and placement of elements.

4. Apply Gestalt Principles

Proximity – Group related items together to show relationships.

Similarity – Use similar colors, shapes, and fonts for related components.

Continuity – Arrange elements in a smooth and logical flow.

Closure – Use visual cues so users perceive complete shapes or sections.

Figure–Ground – Highlight important elements using contrast and background separation.

5. Incorporate UI Elements

Add buttons, navigation bars, icons, search bars, cards, images, forms, and call-to-action elements.

6. Follow Design Patterns

Use hamburger menu for mobile navigation.

Implement card-based layout for displaying products.

Apply grid layout for the web version.

7. Define Interaction Behaviors

Provide hover effects, tap feedback, smooth transitions, and loading indicators for better user interaction.

8. Apply Usability Principles

Ensure consistency, visibility of system status, error prevention, user control, and easy navigation.

9. Create Brand Logo

Design a simple and consistent brand logo using Canva, following color and typography guidelines.

10. Integrate and Finalize Design

Place the logo and UI components in both mobile and web layouts and finalize the design after usability checks.
